  - compilers and formally verified optimizations
  - computational complexity theory, theory of computation
- Neovim, Split-Keyboards, Linux, Typst
- Law

  draft info for me:
- book nerd

      TODO: add somewhere my English teaching experience and maybe a page or two for my students (mb also add a preview video of my accent?; add IELTS certificate); think about making this accessible only by link – without displaying on the website itself
      TODO: create a list-page for my repos/projects/portfolio, that will look similar to Posts/, but have little preview's next to them. For sure will require some tweaking of the theme internals.
      TODO: add page (like Posts/) with my link dump
